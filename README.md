# Raspberry-C-code
If you do not have GIT installed, then under any of the Debian releases (e.g. Raspbian), you can install it with:

####sudo apt-get install git-core
If you get any errors here, make sure your Pi is up to date with the latest versions of Raspbian:

####sudo apt-get update
####sudo apt-get upgrade
To obtain WiringPi using GIT:

####git clone git://git.drogon.net/wiringPi
If you have already used the clone operation for the first time, then

####cd wiringPi
####git pull origin
####git clone https://github.com/yoyojacky/Raspberry-C-code.git
